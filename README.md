A Twitter clone made at BYU

This is an example of a project made in an advanced software engineering computer science course at BYU. It is a Twitter clone that has full functionality except the data used is dummy data generated in the app. The app has user authentication and was built using an MVP pattern. We used AWS API Gateway endpoints to send requests and recieve responses from a server facade. The MVP pattern allowed us to loosely couple the view to the model. All communication between the view-presenter and presenter-model happened through a series of interfaces. Our view components utilized presenters which would perform async tasks and use observers to keep track of them.

This code specifically belongs to a fellow BYU student as my code was lost before I ever uploaded to github. Our code would be virtually identical by completion and is shown for demonstrative purposes only.
